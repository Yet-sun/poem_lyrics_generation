It doesn't impress her that he's got the best ride
It doesn't impress her cos she's seen all the lies
Independent, poised, elegant smile
She is everything and more oh...
Fighter by day, Lover by night
Ooh she's a Cinderella
But only on the outside
Cos once you find your way inside
You will see she's just the gullible girl
She's so awfully swell
She does everything well
She moves to the House on the dance floor
While I'm Swingin' nine to four
And she would go ah ah ah,
While I go la la la la A sip of a wine
There's plenty of time
The pleasure is mine
She's awfully swell
And she knows me so well
And she'd go singing on the sofa
While I'm strummin my guitar
I'm feelin some jazz tonight
So turn out the lights
Under the stars
There we will lie
Our love goes sky high
There's our sweet lullaby

She's so awfully swell
She does everything well
She moves to the House on the dance floor
While I'm Swingin' nine to four
And she would go ah ah ah,
While I go la la la la A sip of a wine
There's plenty of time
The pleasure is mine
She's awfully swell
And she knows me so well
And she'd go singing on the sofa
While I'm strummin my guitar
I'm feelin some jazz tonight
So turn out the lights
Under the stars
There we will lie
Our love goes sky high
There's our sweet lullaby

She's so awfully swell
She does everything well
She moves to the House on the dance floor
While I'm Swingin' nine to four
 she would go ah ah ah,
While I go la la la la A sip of a wine
There's plenty of time
The pleasure is mine
She's awfully swell
And she knows me so well
And she'd go singing on the sofa
While I'm strummin my guitar
I'm feelin some jazz tonight
So turn out the lights
(Under the stars
There we will lie
Our love goes sky high
There's our sweet lullaby)*2
