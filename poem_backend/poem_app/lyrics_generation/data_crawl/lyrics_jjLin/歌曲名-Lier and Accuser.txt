Oh come fill these dried waters

That is my heart's one desire

The one who does not falter

You are my heart's one desire

I'd be with you just a little longer

They don't even know me

With their tongues they crucify me

Won't you vindicate me

Fend me from those false accusations

So the lier and accuser

Shall be judged by the father's fire

So as they feed on my honour

They will also feed his anger

Those words are fuelling the flame

They don't even know me

With their words they terrorise me

Won't you vindicate me

Fend me from those false accusations

Save me from this wretched perversion

Destroying those disguises

Ushering the misguided

May your light shine through
May your light shine
Shine shine shine

Destroying those disguises

Ushering the misguided

May your light shine through
May your light shine
Shine shine shine

Oh come fill these dried waters

That is my heart's one desire

The one who does not falter

You are my heart's one desire

To be with you just a little longer
