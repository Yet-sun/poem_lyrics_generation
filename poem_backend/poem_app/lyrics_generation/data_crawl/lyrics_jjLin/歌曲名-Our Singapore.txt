It isn't easy building something out of nothing

Especially when the road ahead's a rocky one

But if we gather all our courage and conviction

And hold our dream up high
The challenge will be won

So now we look around us and we see

A nation built with love by you and me

A land to treasure right down to the core

Our home our heart our Singapore

Our home our heart our Singapore

Through many years gone by
We've moved ahead together

We've built a brave new world
Where we could shine and grow
And now we only have to look towards tomorrow

To carry on the dream as far as it will go

So now we look around us and we see

A nation built with love by you and me

A land to treasure right down to the core

Our home our heart our Singapore

Our home our heart our Singapore

And amazing as it seems

It all started with a dream
And our dreaming isn't done
Cause the best is yet to come

Our home our heart our Singapore

Our home our heart our dream our Singapore

Singapore Singapore our Singapore
