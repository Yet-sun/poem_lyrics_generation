I've been going in circles

With no direction

Round and round I am spinning

Just when I think I'm moving forward

I discover

That I'm back at the beginning

But morning comes I see the sun rise

And it reminds me
Every day is a new day

And if it takes a million more tries

I'll never give up

I know I will find a way
Though it's hard to see
But the power is inside of me

If we dare to dream
I know we can do anything hey hey

Love is all we need

Together we'll fly
Oh
To infinity and beyond

If we only believe

We can reach the sky

Oh
To infinity and beyond

Oh oh oh

To infinity and beyond

Oh oh oh

To infinity and beyond

I've been going in circles

With no direction

Round and round I am spinning

Just when I think I'm moving forward

I discover

That I'm back at the beginning

But morning comes I see the sun rise

And it reminds me

Every day is a new day

And if it takes a million more tries

I'll never give up
I know I will find a way
Though it's hard to see
But the power is inside of me

If we dare to dream
I know we can do anything hey hey

Love is all we need

Together we'll fly

Oh
To infinity and beyond

If we only believe
We can reach the sky
Oh
To infinity and beyond

Oh oh oh

To infinity and beyond

Oh oh oh

To infinity and beyond

Love is all we need
Together we'll fly

To infinity and beyond

If we only believe

We can reach the sky

To infinity and beyond
