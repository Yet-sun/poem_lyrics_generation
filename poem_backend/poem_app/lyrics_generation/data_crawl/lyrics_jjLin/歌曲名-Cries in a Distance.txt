Cries in a distance
Can't stop the tremble
I'm just awaiting my turn

Hiding will never
Save me forever
The guns gonna get me for sure

Dear God I pray why won't you be my friend
Come to me and take my hand
Like mama would say
Everything will be okay

All I hear is 3 2 1
The scream from the guns
And then 1by1
No one gets to run
Someone's dad or mom
Sister, brother and son
No…no…

All I feel is 1 2 3
My tears start to bleed
Smell of roses on my feet
I feel sore…
I fall…
I call…
I crawl…
