Girl you know I miss you so
I didn't know you had to go
You've had enough of our distance baby
Before I had the chance to say
I'm staying with you
For the rest of my life Oh

Don't keep telling me these words
You don't know how much it hurts Oh
And I'll promise you eternity
If you promise me your stay
But now it's too late
I'm no longer the man that I was

I will go on without her
Like a fool who's too sure
I'm like a bird who's lost her wing
A fire without its flame

I don't know how to be strong
When my love has to move on
I am a song without a soul
Now that she's gone
What's left of us is this song

Don't keep telling me these words Oh No
You don't know how much it hurts Oh
And I'll promise you eternity
If you promise me your stay
But now it's too late
I'm no longer the man that I was Woo

And I will go on without her Woo
Like a fool who's too sure Oh Yeah
I'm like a bird who's lost her wing
A fire without its flame

I don't know how to be strong
When my love has to move on
I am a song without a soul
Now that she's gone
What's left of us is this song

Oh Oh Yeah I'm know I'm know
Baby I'm know I'm a fool

And I will go on without her
Like a fool who's too sure Oh
I'm like a bird who's lost her wing
A fire without its flame

I don't know how to be strong
When my love has to move on
I am a song without a soul
Now that she's gone
What's left of us is this song

This is our song without a soul
Now that you're gone
What's left of us in this song
