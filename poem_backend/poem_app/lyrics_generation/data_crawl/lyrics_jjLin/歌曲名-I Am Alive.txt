 作词 : 林俊杰/Jason Mraz

When I fear the sky might fall
and no one will hear my call
I take a breath and see
I've all the strength I need
Days won't be the same
Everything will change
Even mountains over time must get redefined
I know, I know life's worth living
I Keep on, I keep on giving
I'm giving it all I got

Giving it my best shot
I Get up, get up and keep on trying
There is no shame in crying
Yesterdays are gone
I have what it takes

I have what it takes to hold on

I am brave and strong
I am every song
I am here to shine
I'm not afraid to fly
I am loveable

I am invincible
I am tough enough
And I'm ready to catch
the falling sky

I am alive

I am alive
Yes I am

The wind is in my face
and I'm feeling out of place
It's me against the entire human race
I know the dreams I chase
They will not be erased
They are my saving grace
I'm gonna make it
I know, I know life's worth living
I keep on, keep on giving
I'm giving it all I got

Giving it my best shot
I get up, get up and keep on trying
There is no shame in crying
Yesterdays are gone
I have what it takes

I have what it takes to hold on
I am brave and strong
I am every song
I am here to shine
I'm not afraid to fly
I am loveable
I am invincible

And I am tough enough
And I'm ready to catch
that falling sky
I am brave and strong
I am every song
I am here to shine
I'm not afraid to fly
I am loveable
I'm invincible

And I am tough enough
And I'm ready to catch the falling sky

I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
Yes I am

I am alive
I am alive
Yes I am
