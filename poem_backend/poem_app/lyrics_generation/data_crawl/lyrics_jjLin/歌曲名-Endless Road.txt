HO~~~~~~~~
The truth is tearing up
my heart
I can‘t recognize this place
The endless road without a stop sign
Can‘t even find a stranger this time
Why am I still holding back my tears
In this loneliness there‘s nothing to fear
Every chord still seems a wonder
How we could be together
Every time I ask if this
Would be the last
Why am I still talking to myself
Hoping you will have the keys to my Sell
Every song might calm the weather
But it just draws me deeper
How do I get out of this
I think I never will……
A crystal forming in the eye
Maybe this would be the last
The winding path down my face
Till I begin to taste the bitterness inside
I never will……
